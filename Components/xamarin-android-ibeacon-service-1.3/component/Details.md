##What does this library do?

It allows Android devices to use iBeacons much like iOS devices do. A Xamarin.Android app can request to get notifications when one or more iBeacons appear or disappear. A Xamarin.Android app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more iBeacons at a frequency of 1Hz.
